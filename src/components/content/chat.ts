**Here's what I found:**

<br/>
The video claims\n
• "Tomatoes will disappear from India next year"\n
• Mentions "climate bans" and "government restrictions"

<br/>

**Credibility Check:**

✓ No verified news reports support this claim \n
✓ Tomato production forecasts remain stable \n
✗ Speaker isn't a verified expert \n
✗ Uses dramatic tone with no cited sources \n

<br/>

**Verdict:** 🚩 **Likely misleading** \n`,

**Why tomato prices spiked:** \n
<br/>
The price increase was primarily due to: \n
• **Heavy rainfall** in key growing regions affecting harvest \n
• **Supply chain delays** disrupting distribution \n
• **Seasonal shortage** during off-peak production periods \n

**Important note:** This was **not** because of any government ban or restriction. \n

<br/>

**Conclusion:** \n

🌱 Tomato prices fluctuate seasonally based on weather and supply conditions, but **no future ban is expected**. The market typically stabilizes as production recovers. \n`,
